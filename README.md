# Final Year Project – Motion of Material Point in Central Force Fields

This repository contains simulation tools and visualizations developed for the study of the motion of a material point under the influence of central force fields.

## 🔬 Project Description

This project is part of a physics final-year thesis titled:
> **"Control of Material Point Motion under the Influence of Central Force Fields"**

The work involves modeling and simulating gravitational and central force fields, including elliptical orbits, planetary systems, and interactive particle dynamics. It applies mathematical formulations to simulate real and idealized space dynamics, with educational and research-use cases.
